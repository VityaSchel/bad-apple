Real size of table is 165.6, we will use 165 for simplier calculations. Also mute sound.

1. ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -s 200x166 -c:a copy -an resized.mp4

Each segment's width is 200/5 (=40) and height is 165/5 (=33)

2. Template command is:
ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -vcodec libwebp -filter:v "crop=40:33:(40*(N%5)):(33*(~~(N/5)))" fps=fps=30 -lossless 1 -loop 1 -preset default fragments/xN_yN.mp4
Where N is fragment's number from 0 to 24

For simplicity, I created a JS script but you can fuck your brain and try to write it in bash, go ahead
Then run sequentially, I'm too tired to write parallel loops
